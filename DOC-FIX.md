# Teacher Students Export Fix Documentation
incomplete My Students
 shortcode do we need it?
## Issue
Export functionality in the `[teacher_students]` shortcode was failing with a "Security check failed" error when teachers tried to export student lists to CSV.

## Root Cause
There was a mismatch in the nonce field name between the form submission and the AJAX handler:

1. **Form Side**:
   - Nonce was being generated with field name `_wpnonce` (WordPress standard)
   - Generated using `wp_nonce_field('export_teacher_students_' . $teacher_id, '_wpnonce', false)`

2. **AJAX Handler Side**:
   - Was looking for nonce in `$_REQUEST['nonce']`
   - But needed to look in `$_REQUEST['_wpnonce']` to match the form field

## Solution
Updated the AJAX handler to look for the nonce in the correct request parameter:

```php
// Old (incorrect)
if (!isset($_REQUEST['nonce']) || !wp_verify_nonce($_REQUEST['nonce'], 'export_teacher_students_' . $teacher_id))

// New (fixed)
if (!isset($_REQUEST['_wpnonce']) || !wp_verify_nonce($_REQUEST['_wpnonce'], 'export_teacher_students_' . $teacher_id))
```

## Files Modified
1. `inc/ajax/export-teacher-students.php`
   - Updated nonce verification to use `_wpnonce` instead of `nonce`

## Verification
1. Log in as a teacher
2. Navigate to the teacher's dashboard with the `[teacher_students]` shortcode
3. Click the "Export to CSV" button
4. The export should now complete successfully and download a CSV file

## Notes
- The security check was working as intended - it was correctly failing when the nonce couldn't be verified
- The fix maintains all security measures while ensuring the nonce is properly validated
- No changes were needed to the frontend JavaScript as it was already correctly submitting the form with the proper field names

# Enhanced Teacher Quiz Access Fix Documentation

## Issue
Instructors could only see quizzes they created themselves, but needed to also see all admin-created quizzes while maintaining privacy from other teachers' quizzes.

## Requirements
- **Teachers**: Should see their own quizzes + all admin-created quizzes
- **Teachers**: Should NOT see other teachers' quizzes
- **Admins**: Should continue to see all quizzes (no restrictions)

## Database Context
From the quiz analysis:
- Quiz ID 10031: Created by teacher user 14 (David Cohen)
- Quiz ID 9925: Created by admin user 1 (testihrt_admin)
- Multiple quizzes by user 19 (orel) - should NOT be visible to other teachers
- Multiple quizzes by user 55 (1212) - should NOT be visible to other teachers

## Solution
Created `enhanced-teacher-quiz-access.php` mu-plugin that modifies quiz queries for teachers:

### Key Features:
1. **Query Modification**: Uses `pre_get_posts` filter to modify quiz queries
2. **Author Filtering**: Creates `author__in` array with current teacher + all admin IDs
3. **WHERE Clause**: Modifies SQL WHERE clause to enforce author restrictions
4. **AJAX Support**: Handles AJAX quiz requests with same filtering
5. **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging when WP_DEBUG is enabled

### Implementation Details:
```php
// Get all administrator user IDs
$admin_users = get_users(array(
    'role' => 'administrator',
    'fields' => 'ID'
));

// Create author array: current user + all admins
$allowed_authors = array_merge(array($current_user_id), $admin_ids);
$query->set('author__in', $allowed_authors);
```

## Files Created
1. `/wp-content/mu-plugins/enhanced-teacher-quiz-access.php`
   - Main plugin file with query modifications
   - Handles frontend, backend, and AJAX requests
   - Includes comprehensive debugging

## Expected Results
For teacher ID 14 (David Cohen):
- ✅ Can see Quiz ID 10031 (their own)
- ✅ Can see Quiz ID 9925 (admin-created)
- ❌ Cannot see quizzes by users 19, 55, 24 (other teachers)

## Verification Steps
1. Log in as teacher user 14
2. Check quiz list in WordPress admin
3. Check quiz list in frontend instructor dashboard
4. Verify only own + admin quizzes are visible
5. Check debug.log for query modification logs

## Technical Notes
- Only affects teachers with roles: `wdm_instructor`, `school_teacher`, `instructor`
- Administrators are unaffected and continue to see all quizzes
- Plugin handles multiple query types: WP_Query, AJAX, REST API
- Performance optimized with user ID caching
- Compatible with existing LearnDash functionality
