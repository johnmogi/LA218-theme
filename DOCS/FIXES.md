## All-in-One WP Migration Backup Path Fix

### Issue
All-in-One WP Migration was trying to save backups to a remote server path instead of the local environment.

### Solution
Updated the backup path in the database to use the local file system.

### SQL Query Executed
```sql
UPDATE `edc_options` 
SET `option_value` = 'c:/Users/USUARIO/Local Sites/bu-lilac-710/app/public/wp-content/backups' 
WHERE `option_name` = 'ai1wm_backups_path';
```

### Notes
- The backups will now be saved to: `wp-content/backups/`
- This directory is version controlled and should be included in your backup strategy
- The path uses forward slashes for cross-platform compatibility

### Verification
1. Go to All-in-One WP Migration > Backups
2. Create a new backup
3. Verify it appears in the `wp-content/backups/` directory

### Additional Information
- This change only affects the local development environment
- Production environment may need a different path configured
- Remember to exclude the backups directory from version control if it contains sensitive data
