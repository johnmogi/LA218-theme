Let's execute the final setup script to complete the LearnDash Instructor Demo configuration:

Ran terminal command
…\test\app\public > mysql -u root -proot -P 10083 local < finalize_setup.sql

mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
ERROR 1292 (22007) at line 25: Truncated incorrect DOUBLE value: 'a:2:{i:0;i:3;i:1;'
Exit Code 1
Go to Terminal

Auto-run
Let me fix the SQL syntax error in the script and update our plan to reflect the current progress.

Planned for 23s

View Plan
Here's a summary of the plan update:

Added a note about the SQL script error (incorrect DOUBLE value) when updating group members, and the need to fix the SQL for group membership serialization.
Updated the task list to reflect that the "Finalize setup" script was attempted and needs a fix for group membership serialization.
Now updating the plan accordingly.

Added
Finalize setup: update group name, assign course, add students, create dashboard page, create gradebook (fix group membership serialization error in SQL and rerun)
Let's fix the SQL script by addressing the group membership serialization issue. I'll update the script to handle the serialized data correctly.
