# Checkout Form Account Fields Update

## Issue Fixed

This update modifies the WooCommerce checkout form to:

1. **Remove Username/Password Fields** - The account creation form fields (username and password) have been removed from the checkout page to streamline the process.

2. **Maintain Account Creation** - Despite removing the fields, the system still creates user accounts automatically during checkout.

3. **Auto-Generate Credentials** - Usernames and passwords are now automatically generated in the background.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `functions.php` - Added new filters to modify the checkout fields and handle account creation

### How It Works

1. **Field Removal**
   - The username and password fields are removed from the checkout form using the `woocommerce_checkout_fields` filter
   - This is purely a UI change - account creation still happens in the background

2. **Automatic Account Creation**
   - The system automatically checks the "Create an account" checkbox for all guest checkouts
   - Usernames are generated using the customer's email prefix and phone number
   - Secure random passwords are generated automatically

3. **Password Reset**
   - Users can set their password using the "Lost Password" link after checkout
   - The system uses WooCommerce's standard password reset functionality

## Reverting the Changes

To restore the original username/password fields:

1. Locate the following code block in `functions.php`:
   ```php
   /**
    * Remove username and password fields from WooCommerce checkout
    */
   add_filter('woocommerce_checkout_fields', function($fields) {
       // ... code ...
   }, 20);
   
   // Force account creation when checking out as guest
   add_filter('woocommerce_create_account_default_checked', '__return_true');
   
   // Auto-generate username and password in the background
   add_filter('woocommerce_checkout_customer', function($customer_data) {
       // ... code ...
   });
   ```

2. Either:
   - Remove this entire code block, or
   - Comment it out by adding `/*` before and `*/` after the block

## Testing

1. **As a Guest**
   - Add a product to cart and proceed to checkout
   - Verify that username/password fields are not visible
   - Complete the checkout process
   - Check that a new user account was created
   - Verify the user receives a "New Account" email

2. **Password Reset**
   - Use the "Lost Password" link on the login page
   - Verify the password reset email is received
   - Test setting a new password and logging in

## Dependencies

- WooCommerce 3.6.0 or higher
- WordPress 5.0 or higher

## Notes

- This change only affects the checkout page - account creation on other pages (like registration) is unchanged
- The system will still require all other billing information (email, phone, etc.)
- User accounts are created with the role 'customer' by default
