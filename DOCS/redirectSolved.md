'll help you fix the redirect issues. Let's check the JavaScript that's handling the redirects:

I've found the issue. The JavaScript code handling the add-to-cart functionality is causing the redirects in the Elementor editor. Let's update the 
add_checkout_redirect_js
 function to exclude the Elementor editor context.

 function to include the same Elementor editor checks:

I've made the necessary updates to prevent the redirects in the Elementor editor while maintaining the "add to cart → checkout" flow for customers. Here's what I did:

Updated 
custom_add_to_cart_redirect
 function to exclude admin and Elementor editor contexts.
Updated 
add_checkout_redirect_js
 function with the same exclusions to prevent JavaScript-based redirects in the editor.
These changes ensure that:

The Elementor editor works without unwanted redirects
The "add to cart → checkout" flow remains unchanged for customers
All redirects are properly scoped to front-end product/cart contexts
The changes are now live in your theme's 
functions.php
 file. You should now be able to:

Use the Elementor editor without being redirected
Still have products automatically redirect to checkout when added to cart on the front-end
If you're still experiencing any issues with the redirects, please let me know and I'll help you troubleshoot further.

can you document this fix with especialy the actual solution ?

I'll document the fix we implemented to prevent unwanted redirects in the Elementor editor while maintaining the "add to cart → checkout" flow. Here's the comprehensive documentation:

WooCommerce Redirect to Checkout Fix for Elementor Editor
The Problem
The site had multiple WooCommerce redirect handlers that were causing unwanted redirects to the checkout page when using the Elementor editor. This made it impossible to edit pages with WooCommerce elements.

Root Cause
Three main components were causing the issue:

PHP Redirect Handler (
custom_add_to_cart_redirect
)
JavaScript Redirect Handler (
add_checkout_redirect_js
)
AJAX Fragment Handler (
intercept_ajax_add_to_cart
)
None of these had proper checks for the Elementor editor context.

The Solution
We implemented checks in all relevant functions to prevent redirects in the following contexts:

WordPress admin area
Elementor editor
Elementor preview mode
Elementor preview parameter in URL
Key Code Changes:
In 
custom_add_to_cart_redirect
 function:
php
// Don't run in admin or Elementor editor
if (is_admin() || 
    (defined('ELEMENTOR_VERSION') && \Elementor\Plugin::$instance->editor->is_edit_mode()) || 
    (defined('ELEMENTOR_VERSION') && \Elementor\Plugin::$instance->preview->is_preview_mode()) ||
    (isset($_GET['elementor-preview']))) {
    return $url;
}
In 
add_checkout_redirect_js
 function:
php
// Don't run in admin or Elementor editor
if (is_admin() || 
    (defined('ELEMENTOR_VERSION') && \Elementor\Plugin::$instance->editor->is_edit_mode()) || 
    (defined('ELEMENTOR_VERSION') && \Elementor\Plugin::$instance->preview->is_preview_mode()) ||
    (isset($_GET['elementor-preview']))) {
    return;
}
In 
intercept_ajax_add_to_cart
 function:
php
// Don't run in admin or Elementor editor
if (is_admin() || 
    (defined('ELEMENTOR_VERSION') && \Elementor\Plugin::$instance->editor->is_edit_mode()) || 
    (defined('ELEMENTOR_VERSION') && \Elementor\Plugin::$instance->preview->is_preview_mode()) ||
    (isset($_GET['elementor-preview']))) {
    return $fragments;
}
How It Works
is_admin(): Prevents execution in the WordPress admin area
Elementor editor check: Uses \Elementor\Plugin::$instance->editor->is_edit_mode() to detect the editor
Elementor preview check: Uses \Elementor\Plugin::$instance->preview->is_preview_mode()
URL parameter check: Looks for ?elementor-preview in the URL
Testing
Frontend:
Add a product to cart → Should redirect to checkout
Cart page → Should work normally
Elementor Editor:
Edit any page with WooCommerce elements
No redirects should occur
All Elementor functionality should work as expected
Notes
The solution maintains all existing WooCommerce functionality
No changes were made to the actual redirect logic, only to the conditions under which it runs
The fix is non-destructive and can be easily reverted if needed
