Thought Process

I need to look at a few more areas to understand how the system actually connects teachers and classes since we can't directly access MySQL. Let's first examine how the Teacher Dashboard actually queries and displays class/student data:

Analyzed
class-teacher-dashboard.php#L75-175
Thought Process




I've discovered something important. Despite what's stated about teachers not being LearnDash group leaders, the Teacher Dashboard code explicitly uses LearnDash's group leader functions to fetch data:

learndash_get_administrators_group_ids($teacher_id, true) to get groups associated with teachers
learndash_get_groups_users($group_id, $student_query_args) to get students in those groups
This indicates a disconnect between the stated business model and the actual code implementation. The code is treating:

Teachers as LearnDash group administrators/leaders
Classes as LearnDash groups
Student-class relationships as LearnDash group memberships
Let me check what the Teacher Class Wizard's actual render code looks like to see how classes are presented:

Analyzed
class-teacher-class-wizard.php#L1000-1200
Thought Process




Looking at the code, I'm seeing a significant disconnect between what you described and what's actually implemented in the code. Let me share what I've found:

Implementation Reality
Teacher-Class Relationship:
The code does use LearnDash group leader functionality:
php
// In assign_teacher_to_group()
if (function_exists('learndash_set_groups_administrators')) {
    learndash_set_groups_administrators($group_id, array($teacher_id));
}
It sets teachers as group leaders via post meta _ld_group_leaders
Class Implementation:
Classes are created as LearnDash groups (post type 'groups'):
php
$class_data = array(
    'post_title' => sanitize_text_field($_POST['new_class_name']),
    'post_type'  => 'groups',
    'post_status' => 'publish',
    // ...
);
Teacher Dashboard:
Uses LearnDash functions to get teacher's classes and students:
php
// Get all groups the teacher is a leader of
$groups = learndash_get_administrators_group_ids($teacher_id, true);

// Get all students in these groups
$group_students = learndash_get_groups_users($group_id, $student_query_args);
This creates a confusing situation where the code is implementing one thing, but the business logic might be treating it differently.

Possible Explanations
The custom code is wrapping LearnDash functionality but treating it differently conceptually
The system evolved over time and the current mental model differs from the implementation
The system actually does use LearnDash structures but with custom extensions
Recommended Approach
Before we proceed with a rebuild, we need to:

Clarify if your statement "Teachers are NOT LearnDash group leaders" means conceptually (in business terms) or technically (in implementation)
Understand which aspects of the current implementation need to be preserved
Determine if we should build on top of LearnDash's existing structure or create something completely separate
Would you like me to:

Create a comprehensive diagram of the current implementation to better visualize the relationships?
Start designing a new system that better separates teachers/classes from LearnDash groups/leaders?
Examine the student enrollment methods in more detail to understand all entry points?
Planned for 21s

View Plan
The plan needs a targeted update to clarify that, despite the business logic statements, the codebase actually does use LearnDash group leader and group structures for teachers and classes. This is critical for accurately mapping the current state and planning the integration/rebuild.

I will add a note to reflect this discovered implementation reality.

Updating now.

Thought Process



I've discovered something critical: there's a significant disconnect between what you described and what's in the actual implementation.

Current Implementation Reality
The code is actually using LearnDash's built-in structures extensively:

Classes ARE LearnDash Groups
php
// Classes are created as 'groups' post type
$class_data = array(
    'post_title' => $_POST['new_class_name'],
    'post_type'  => 'groups',
    // ...
);
Teachers ARE Set as LearnDash Group Leaders
php
// Teacher_Class_Wizard explicitly makes teachers group leaders
learndash_set_groups_administrators($group_id, array($teacher_id));
The Teacher Dashboard Uses LearnDash APIs
php
// Gets teacher's groups using LearnDash function
$groups = learndash_get_administrators_group_ids($teacher_id, true);

// Gets students from groups using LearnDash function
$group_students = learndash_get_groups_users($group_id, $student_query_args);
This means the current system is built on top of LearnDash's group/leader structure, even if conceptually you think of them differently.

For Our Rebuild Options
Enhance Current Structure
Build a better abstraction layer over LearnDash
Unify the various enrollment methods
Maintain LearnDash's data model but improve the UI/UX
Create Separate System
Build completely separate teacher-class-student tables
Create connectors to LearnDash for course content only
Implement new enrollment and progress tracking
Which approach would you prefer? Would you like to keep the LearnDash foundation but improve it, or build something completely separate?
